            <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
            <p>
                We implemented a simple 2D grid-based smoke simulation. Using the particle-based fluid simulation starter code, we converted the particle-based method to a grid-based method of simulation. Although currently it appears 2D for runtime and debugging
                purposes, it currently represents a 2D view of a plane of 3D simulation, to facilitate expansion. Our current method for fluid simulation relies on diffusion between neighboring grid squares. It decently simulates point sources of smoke, but lacks
                implementations of turbulence or velocity.
            </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Progress Relative to Plan</h2>
            <p>
                Implementing the grid-based smoke simulation in a way that looked good proved far more difficult than initially anticipated, so we spent a lot of unplanned time on that. As a result, we didn't get to implementing the GPU-based computation that we
                planned to get to for the milestone. Additionally, our original plan was to only render animations at the milestone, however with minor optimization and collapsing we were able to get the smoke animation to render real time. We are still on track to
                finish our original baseline plan. Although the current simulation is 2D, its 3D-rendering-of-2D nature makes implementing that simple and a matter of increasing performance to support it, and the grid-based updater makes us able to add velocity and
                vorticity fairly easily once we solve or find numerical solutions to the relevant fluid dynamics equations.
