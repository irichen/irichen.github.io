<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>
  We will implement a grid-based fluid dynamics simulator, specifically focusing on rendering smoke. We will also use OpenGL to parallelize computation using the GPU and allow for real-time simulation.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p><i>
  Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
</p></i>

<p>
  Smoke simulation is important and cool as fluids are everywhere in our world, and fluid simulation can add realism to a movie or video game. Plus, animating pixels to simulate real life phenomena is just awesome. However, it is also extremely complicated and challenging as we need to take into account the physics and mathematics behind fluid dynamics. Since there seem to be two popular methods of fluid simulation, particle-based and grid-based, we decided to go with the grid-based approach as some sources indicate that particle-based can be slower especially with many particles  Additionally, since fluid dynamics simulation is typically very computationally expensive, we will need to take on the additional challenge of rendering with GLSL shaders to utilize the GPU. We will use the Navier-Stokes equation to simulate fluid dynamics. A challenge for smoke simulation as compared to other fluid simulations is that smoke tends to be more turbulent. However, as the Navier-Stokes equation mostly factors in fluid velocity, pressure, density, and viscocity, to simulate smoke, we may need to account for additional factors including vorticity (to account for the curls that smoke is most typically associated with), buoyancy, temperature, and concentration, as Yunfeng Bai described in his paper.

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p><i>
  This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate). If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create. Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.

  <b>&#9758;  Baseline Plan</b><br>

  For our demo, we plan to create visually appealing and (most importantly) realistic 3D smoke animations.

  <br><br><b>&#9758;  Aspirational Plan</b><br>
  If all goes well, we would like to allow for real-time simulation and add in mouse interaction so that the user may wave around the source of the smoke, wave their hand around the smoke, or create more plumes as desired. Additionally, if all goes really well, we would like to add in smoke simulations with solid obstacles, such that the smoke may realistally dissipate around a denser object. We would like to integrate this feature with our interactive demo such that the user may add in and move around the solid objects as well as the smoke.
